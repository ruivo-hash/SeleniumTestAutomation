# Tricents Web Project Automation

Automation project of site Tricents using Selenium WebDriver and Java

# Robot Framework
To use Robot Framework to select a file in Picture input in Insurant Data Form, I left a picture in directory project that named "userPicture", use this picture, with exactly the same name, in your default browser directory (normally is your user folder, inside "C:/users/{your user folder}").
